# Weller WE 1010NA Backlight
This is a reasonably straight forward upgrade for the Weller WE 1010NA soldering iron. With three modifications you can add a backlight:
 - Two soldered wires (gnd + 5v)
 - One modified mounting point

# Commercial Use
I currently have 14 assembled kits which you can buy from me directly for $10 each. If you are in the US shipping will be approximately $3.50.
