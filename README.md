# Weller WE 1010NA Backlight
This is a reasonably straight forward upgrade for the Weller WE 1010NA soldering iron. With three modifications you can add a backlight:
 - Two soldered wires (gnd + 5v)
 - One modified mounting point

# Commercial Use
I currently have 14 assembled kits which you can buy from me directly for $10 each. If you are in the US shipping will be approximately $3.50.

Licensing of this project permits commercial use. The source files are configured to allow for assembled orders with JLCPCB.

Licensing requires this project is listed with the following:
 - Clearly link to this GitHub repo in your description.
 - Clearly list "Stephen Arsenault" as the creator of this project.

# Assembly
Learn more about assembly [here](ASSEMBLY.md).
 - Warnings:
   - Any scratches in your LCD or the protective lense will become more evident. ([Low-Light](images/after_dark.jpg?raw=true)) ([Lighted Room](images/after_lights.jpg?raw=true))
   - The screen is visible in dark light but contrast is lowered. I believe this is due to the lack of reflective rear-coating on the Weller LCD.

# Commercial Use
